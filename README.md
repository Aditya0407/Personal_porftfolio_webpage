### Setup Instructions

2. Get your API key from the Together AI dashboard
3. Replace `YOUR_TOGETHER_API_KEY` in script.js with your actual API key

> Note: If no API key is provided, the chatbot will fall back to a local response system that still provides accurate information based on the resume data.

## Future Improvements
